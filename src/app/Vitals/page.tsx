      <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
      <p>
        The healthcare industry faces challenges in managing EMRs due to issues
        like data fragmentation, limited interoperability, privacy concerns, and
        vulnerabilities to unauthorized access. Centralized EMR systems are
        prone to data breaches and system failures, hindering collaboration and
        compromising patient privacy.
      </p>
      <h2>Our Solutions</h2>
      <p>
        Our solution leverages blockchain technology to address key challenges
        in EMR management, ensuring data integrity and security, promoting
        interoperability and data sharing, protecting patient privacy and
        consent, and streamlining healthcare processes.

      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p>
        Since there was an already existing ecosystem for EMR software, my team
        and I conducted in-depth interviews with healthcare professionals,
        including doctors, nurses, and administrative staff, to understand their
        daily workflows and pain points when using EMR software. We also met
        various individuals and asked them about their experience with their
        medical record, privacy and possible changes they would want to have.
        <span>Through the research, we intend to:</span>
        Identify the target market for EMR software Understand users
        frustrations Define a problem statement
      </p>

      <h2>Building Empathy</h2>
      <p>
        Empathizing with users ensure that my team and I understands users need
        and it will help us to create products and experiences that truly
        resonate with users. This empathetic approach ensures that design
        solutions are not only functional but also meaningful and enjoyable for
        the people who use them. Ultimately, empathy is the foundation for
        creating user experiences that leave a lasting positive impression.
      </p>
      {/* User pesrona image */}
      <h2>Empathy Map</h2>
      <p>
        This process helped inform the design of EMR software by providing a
        comprehensive understanding of users, their needs, challenges, and
        emotional states. This information guided the design process, ensuring
        that the resulting software is user-centric, efficient, and empathetic
        to the unique demands of healthcare professionals and administrators.
      </p>
      {/* empathy image */}
      <h2>IDEATION & Brainstorming</h2>
      <p>
        This is the point where we started sharing solution ideas. We used HMW
        questions to explore different angles of the problem. These questions
        are typically framed as open-ended challenges. We were informed by the
        insights gained from the empathy map.
